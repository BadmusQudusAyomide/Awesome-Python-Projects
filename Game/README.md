# Tic-Tac-Toe Game using Python

I have used Python to construct an automatic version of the well-known game Tic-Tac-Toe. There is no need for user input because the programme plays the game automatically.
numpy and random Python libraries are used to build this game. Code randomly selects a spot on the board and places the mark rather than asking the user to do it.
It will display the board after each turn unless a player wins.It returns -1 if the game is a draw.

# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Game using Python
Python is a programming language, and we're going to be modifying a Rock, Paper, Scissors game today!

Games are powered by rules, and this is no exception! We'll be writing the rules to make our code work using Python.
