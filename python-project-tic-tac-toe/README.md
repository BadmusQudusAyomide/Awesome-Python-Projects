HOW TO PLAY TIC TAC TOE GAME 

It's a really simple game, right? That's what most people think. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't quite as simple as you think! 

RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE 

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. 

2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. 

3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. 

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
