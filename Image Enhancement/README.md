A new technique to enhance images through image processing.

## About Project

Images captured by the surveillance cameras are generally very low in quality and not able to detect some of the minute details.

You can use your experties in programing. you can use programming to enhance an image so much so that the lesser details get enhanced.

Here I used one technique called "Histogram equalisation specification" or "CLAHE". 


## Code Explanation 

```bash
  import cv2 package
```
```bash
  Reading image and giveing file path
```
```bash
  Preparation for CLAHE
```
```bash
  Convert to gray scale image
```
```bash
  Apply Enhancment
```
```bash
  Save it to file
```
