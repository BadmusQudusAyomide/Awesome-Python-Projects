# Digital Clock Using Python

This is a simple digital clock built using Python. 
  
  
  Digital clock uses digits to display the time in a digital format. Both 12 and 24 hour formats are possible. In this code, we are using a 24 hour format.

 For this digital clock, we need two different python modules viz Tkinter and Time.
 
- ### Time Module

 Time module comes with Python. There is no need to install it manually.
 
- ### Tkinter Module
 
 Tkinter module has to be installed manually by using pip package manager. Use the following pip command: 
 
```
        pip install tkinter
```

We will need to import both these modules on our python code.
