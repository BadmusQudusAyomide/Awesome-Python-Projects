- The project involves development of a **Machine Learning model using Random Forest Classifier algorithm** which classifies the authenticity of a paper currency.
- The model gets trained on data (BankNote_Authentication.csv).
- The source code in which the model is created & trained on the data is converted into pickle format so that it can be transported and used in various types of frontend.
- Two different frontends have been created using Flask , Flasgger and Streamlit. Both can work independently.
