# OOPs Library Using Python🔥

Motive of this project is to create an “Online Library Management System.”

## 📌Let’s Create 
- Python has a large collection of libraries due to the very active community which serves various purposes.

For this Project, We have to create a library class that includes the following methods:

- Displaybook() : To display the available books
- Lendbook(): To lend a book to a user
- Addbook(): To add a book to the library
- Returnbook(): To return the book to the library.


As we have created a library class, now we will create an object and pass the following parameters in the constructor.

demo=Library(listofbooks, library_name)

After that, create a main function and run an infinite while loop that asks the users for their input whether they want to display, lend, add or return a book.

This is how we can build our OOPs Library with Python.
Happy Coding!!
