## Description

The Currency Converter is an interactive Python program that allows users to convert between different currencies. It provides exchange rates for a variety of currencies and performs real-time currency conversions based on user input.

## Features

- Converts between multiple currencies.
- Provides an easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Usage

1. Run the `Currency_Converter.py` script.
